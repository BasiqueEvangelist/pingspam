# Pingspam
*Summon those pesky AFKers, alt-tabbers and chat-ignorers with this one simple trick!*  
Pingspam makes mentions in the chat (i.e "@GreatGrayOwl" or even "@everyone") ping mentioned players by playing a bell
sound and showing text in the actionbar. Messages containing pings can be displayed and cleared using the
`/notifications` command.
