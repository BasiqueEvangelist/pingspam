# Pingspam
[![Modrinth Badge](https://waffle.coffee/modrinth/pingspam/downloads)](https://modrinth.com/mod/pingspam)

*Summon those pesky AFKers, alt-tabbers and chat-ignorers with this one simple trick!*  
Pingspam makes mentions in the chat ping mentioned players. You can mention by name (i.e "@GreatGrayOwl") or use @everyone (ops only!)

The ping is highlighted in chat, plays a sound for the player, and hogs the actionbar until dismissed.

Messages containing pings can be displayed and dismissed using the
`/notifications` command.

## Server/client parts

This is a mostly server-side mod. Clients are not required to have Pingspam to ~~suffer from~~ enjoy advanced attention-grabbing techniques.

However, chat autocompletion requires the mod on the client.
